# PotholeDetection
Project for the course "Visual Information Processing and Management" at University of Milan Bicocca (a.a. 2021/2022). 

The dataset used as training set is [Annotated Potholes Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitholian/annotated-potholes-dataset?select=annotated-images).

The detection task is carried out with [YOLOv4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/tree/yolov4) and [YOLOv4-tiny](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/tree/yolov4), implemented in the [Darknet framework](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet).

The datasets, the PowerPoint presentation and the best models' weights are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1talxVG6_OqUvEruzMEVPVOZjB-IV4XKj?usp=sharing) (unfortunately, the presentation is only avilable in italian).
